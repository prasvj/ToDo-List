# ToDo-List
Small project of a to do list made with Bootstrap 4, CSS, and pure JS.

Story-Pt. Vyankatmakhi, a scholar who has a technique to categorize numerous ragas into pre-defined thhats(classes) on his name. His disciples are helping him out with delegating different tasks to each other. The tasks can be repeated until the team makes the reports for a conference (where the Vyanktamakhi is supposed to present his idea).

One can add tasks from pre-defined task list (which has 6 tasks), remove them, and update their status in Doing and Done lists.
The tasks are sorted with priorities and added in descending order. 

Working-
1. After adding the tasks, the user has Start and Delete buttons. Start button is for setting that task in progress and Delete removes it     from the to do list.
2. Once the task is in progress, it can be put to the done list by clicking on Done. Also the task can be added back to to do list by         clicking on Repeat.
